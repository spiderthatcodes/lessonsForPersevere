#Destructuring Assignment

Using the example file, destructuring.js, create your own examples of each of the data structures. For each, create new variables with destructuring. Also, create your own version of both functions to manipulate the destructured variables. 

Donâ€™t overthink this. Feel free to copy my exact code structure using your own words. The point is to reinforce this knowledge and make sure you know how each piece works together.

Please finish this by the end of day on Friday.
